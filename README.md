Functional programming in Dart and Flutter. All the main functional programming types and patterns fully documented, tested, and with examples.

> **Fpdart is fully documented. You do not need to have any previous experience with functional programming to start using `fpdart`. Give it a try!**

Fpdart is inspired by [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/), [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html#type-classes-in-cats), and [dartz](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz).

> **Note**: The API is still evolving and it may change. New documentation and testing is always ongoing. Follow my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/SandroMaglione) for updates

## ‚ú® Examples

### [Option](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/blob/540431746d616d30fadf36cc9d1a77c14baf35f4/lib/src/option.dart#L40)

```dart
/// Create an instance of [Some]
final option = Option.of(10);

/// Create an instance of [None]
final none = Option<int>.none();

/// Map [int] to [String]
final map = option.map((a) => '$a');

/// Extract the value from [Option]
final value = option.getOrElse(() => -1);

/// Pattern matching
final match = option.match(
  (a) => print('Some($a)'),
  () => print('None'),
);

/// Convert to [Either]
final either = option.toEither(() => 'missing');

/// Chain computations
final flatMap = option.flatMap((a) => Option.of(a + 10));

/// Return [None] if the function throws an error
final tryCatch = Option.tryCatch(() => int.parse('invalid'));
```

### [Either](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/blob/9da7cae3b9f9dc690ff3255004393c4b979183e9/lib/src/either.dart#L16)

```dart
/// Create an instance of [Right]
final right = Either<String, int>.of(10);

/// Create an instance of [Left]
final left = Either<String, int>.left('none');

/// Map the right value to a [String]
final mapRight = right.map((a) => '$a');

/// Map the left value to a [int]
final mapLeft = right.mapLeft((a) => a.length);

/// Return [Left] if the function throws an error.
/// Otherwise return [Right].
final tryCatch = Either.tryCatch(
  () => int.parse('invalid'),
  (e, s) => 'Error: $e',
);

/// Extract the value from [Either]
final value = right.getOrElse((l) => -1);

/// Chain computations
final flatMap = right.flatMap((a) => Either.of(a + 10));

/// Pattern matching
final match = right.match(
  (l) => print('Left($l)'),
  (r) => print('Right($r)'),
);

/// Convert to [Option]
final option = right.toOption();
```

### üì¶ Immutable Collections

Fpdart provides some extension methods on `Iterable` (`List`) and `Map` that extend the methods available by providing some functional programming signatures (safe methods that never mutate the original collection and that never throw exceptions).

Integrations for immutable collections (`IList`, `ISet`, `IMap`, etc.) are still being discussed with the community. `fpdart` does not want to be another immutable collection solution in the ecosystem. That is why we are working to integrate `fpdart` with other more mature packages that already implements immutable collections. Stay tuned!

### More

Many more examples are coming soon. Check out [**my website**](https://www.sandromaglione.com/) and my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/SandroMaglione) for daily updates.

## üí° Motivation

Functional programming is becoming more and more popular, and for good reasons.

Many non-functional languages are slowly adopting patterns from functional languages, dart included. Dart already supports higher-order functions, generic types, type inference. Other functional programming features are coming to the language, like [pattern matching](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/546), [destructuring](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/207), [multiple return values](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/68), [higher-order types](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1655).

Many packages are bringing functional patterns to dart, like the amazing [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for unions/pattern matching.

Fpdart aims to provide all the main types found in functional languages to dart. Types like `Option` (handle missing values without `null`), `Either` (handle errors and error messages), `Task` (composable async computations), and more.

### Goal

Differently from many other functional programming packages, `fpdart` aims to introduce functional programming to every developer. For this reason, every type and method is commented and documented directly in the code.

> **You do not need to have any previous experience with functional programming to start using `fpdart`.**

Fpdart also provides [real-world examples](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/tree/main/example/src) of why a type is useful and how it can be used in your application. Check out [**my website**](https://www.sandromaglione.com/) for blog posts and articles.

### Comparison with `dartz`

One of the major pain points of dartz has always been is [**lack of documentation**](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz/issues/36). This is a huge issue for people new to functional programming to attempt using the package.

`dartz` was [released in 2016](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz/commits/master?after=2de2f2787430dcd4ef49485bbf8aac1f8d1ff157+279&branch=master), initially targeting Dart 1.

`dartz` is also missing some features and types (`Reader`, `TaskEither`, and others).

Fpdart is a rewrite based on fp-ts and cats. The main differences are:

- Fpdart is fully documented.
- Fpdart implements higher-kinded types using [defunctionalization](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf).
- Fpdart is based on Dart 2.
- Fpdart is completely null-safe from the beginning.
- Fpdart has a richer API.
- Fpdart implements some missing types in dartz.
- Fpdart (currently) does not provide implementation for immutable collections (`ISet`, `IMap`, `IHashMap`, `AVLTree`).

## ü§î Roadmap

Being documentation and stability important goals of the package, every type will go through an implementation-documentation-testing cycle before being considered as _'stable'_.

The roadmap for types development is highlighted below (breaking changes to _'stable'_ types are to be expected in this early stages):

1. ~~`Option`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
2. ~~`Either`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
3. ~~`Unit`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
4. ~~`Task`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
5. ~~`TaskEither`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
6. ~~`Tuple`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
7. ~~`State`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
8. ~~`Reader`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
9. ~~`IO`~~
   - ~~Implementation~~
   - ~~Documentation~~
   - ~~Testing~~
10. ~~`IOEither`~~
    - ~~Implementation~~
    - ~~Documentation~~
    - ~~Testing~~
11. ~~`TaskOption`~~
    - ~~Implementation~~
    - ~~Documentation~~
    - ~~Testing~~
12. `ReaderEither`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing
13. `ReaderTask`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing
14. `ReaderTaskEither`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing
15. `StateReaderTaskEither`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing
16. `Writer`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing
17. `Lens`
    - Implementation
    - Documentation
    - Testing

The long-term goal is to provide all the main types and typeclasses available in other functional programming languages and packages. All the types should be **completely** documented and fully tested.

A well explained documentation is the key for the long-term success of the project. **Any article, blog post, or contribution is welcome**.

In general, **any contribution or feedback is welcome** (and encouraged!).
